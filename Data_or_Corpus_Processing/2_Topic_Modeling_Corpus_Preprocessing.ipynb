      "\"We can't hold a referendum on immigration in France,\" Bruno Retailleau said, speaking to broadcaster LCI late on Sunday. \"I regret that.\"\n",
      "Asked whether he personally wanted to hold such a popular vote, the hardline minister said: \"yes, a thousand times yes,\" adding that \"the constitution would first have to be revised.\"\n",
      "France currently cannot hold a referendum on immigration as the issue is not within the scope of subjects on which such votes can be held.\n",
      "Retailleau said that over the past 50 years immigration has greatly affected French society, yet the French have not had the \"opportunity to express their opinion\".\n",
      "The French have, of course, been able to express their opinion in the multiple elections in which anti-immigration parties have fielded candidates over the past 50 years.\n",
      "Stating that he did not think that immigration presented \"an opportunity\" for France, the minister said it should be controlled and he was ready to use \"all levers at our disposal.\"\n",
      "\"Immigration can only be brought under control if we have an overall plan,\" he added.\n",
      "The appointment of Retailleau, who says his priority is \"restoring order\", is emblematic of the rightward shift of the government under new Prime Minister Michel Barnier following this summer's legislative elections that resulted in a hung parliament.\n",
      "A recent rape and murder of a 19-year-old Paris student has further inflamed a debate on immigration in France after a Moroccan was named as the suspected attacker. The 22-year-old suspect was arrested in Switzerland last week.\n",
      "French authorities say the man had been the subject of an expulsion order.\n",
      "On Sunday, Retailleau pointed to the possibility of extending the maximum duration of detention for people subject to an order to leave France (known as an OQTF) among other measures.\n",
      "Separately, speaking to Le Journal du Dimanche, the interior minister said \"the rule of law is neither intangible nor sacred.\"\n",
      "Reacting to Retailleau's remarks, Yael Braun-Pivet, speaker as parliament's lower house, the National Assembly, said she was \"concerned\".\n",
      "\"When the situation is tense, when there are crises, the rule of law must not be called into question,\" she said on Monday.\n",
      "Former president Nicolas Sarkozy said \"immigration is a problem\" and France needed to \"change everything,\" even though there is no \"magic formula.\"\n",
